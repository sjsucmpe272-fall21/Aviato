#### Introduction to problem statement:-
National Football League (NFL) coaches celebrate a big W, they strategize ways to improve field position and score points. Both of these objectives receive significant contributions from special teams plays, which consist of punts, kickoffs, field goals and extra points. These play types take on important roles in a gameâ€™s final score.Yet special teams remain an understudied part of American football, with an opportunity for data science to offer better ways to understand its impact.
 
#### Abstract:-
Utilize the pre-built dataset from kaggle to train the machine learning model to help evaluate teams performance and analysis.

#### Approach:-
The web-app frontend will be made using ReactJS, HTML CSS and Bootstrap, with the backend technology being NodeJs for creating the RESTful API's. We will use the NOSQL database MONGODB for storage purposes. Kaggle will be used for dataset collection. ML model will be used to train the dataset in Python(TensorFlow).
