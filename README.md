### Idea-1: 
### Property Sales Trend using AI
#### Introduction to problem statement:-
The rising cost of housing in the USA has recently been a concern even more in the time of pandemic. People want to know if its a good time to buy a house or they should wait. We plan to solve this problem by taking the housing trends from the past and predict the future market.
 
#### Abstract:-
Utilize the pre-built dataset from kaggle to train the machine learning model to predict the future market scenario. 

#### Approach:-
The web-app frontend will be made using ReactJS, HTML CSS and Bootstrap, with the backend technology being NodeJs for creating the RESTful API's. We will use the NOSQL database MONGODB for storage purposes. Kaggle will be used for dataset collection. ML model will be used to train the dataset in Python(TensorFlow).


#### Persona:-
##### John :  
John is looking to buy house in San Jose, he realises the market value for houses are rising daily and he is in state of confusion whether he should buy the house or not. He is afraid that the more he waits, prices will go high. He can use our website to get an idea what will be the near future trends of the market and make decisions accordingly.

### Idea-2:
#### Business growth using Consumer shopping trend 

#### Problem Statement:
In this fast growing business world e-commerce companies want to be ahead of their competitors by all means. Companies want to know which items the consumers are willing to buy the most. We can improve their business by knowing the shopping trends of their consumers and predict the list of products which they can sell for being the best in the market.

#### Abstract:
Utilize the pre-built dataset from kaggle to train the machine learning model to predict the list of products which are best fit for consumers. 

#### Approach:
The web-app frontend will be made using ReactJS, HTML CSS and Bootstrap, with the backend technology being NodeJs for creating the RESTful API's. We will use the NOSQL database MONGODB for storage purposes. Kaggle will be used for dataset collection. ML model will be used to train the dataset in Python(TensorFlow).
Docker will be utilized for containerization and AWS EC2 for application hosting.

#### Persona:
Target wants to improve its business by knowing the requirements of their customers. It can use our website to know the shopping trends of the consumers and stock their warehouse accordingly.

### Idea-3:
#### Personalized Food Recommendation System

#### Introduction to the problem statement :
Every now and then, when a person feels hungry, he or she is confused about what they would like to eat or drink right away. There might be a lot of options to choose from, yet, somehow we always find ourselves confused with making that choice, which is why we are building a tailored food recommendation algorithm which can identify previous peculiar user trends and suggest good options to eat. 

#### Abstract:
Utilizing the kaggle food recommendation dataset to train the machine learning model and modify it with AI, uniquely for each user, to recommend them food and drink options at any given time of the day. 

#### Approach: 
Using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, React and VueJS to build a food recommendation web application, which stores the user’s dietary preferences in MongoDB in order to modify the recommendation model, and suggest good food or drink options. 

#### Persona:
Jake :  Jake just had his morning breakfast and he is off to work, but a few hours later he is quite hungry and can’t figure out what to have for lunch. He can use his tailored food recommendation application, which matches that Jake has quite enjoyed his salad bowl meals particularly on weekdays and when he usually comes for lunch a little late around 2 PM, the application will recommend a healthy bowl of salad due to the strong match
