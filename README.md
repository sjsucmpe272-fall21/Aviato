### Idea-1: 
### DORM RATING APP
#### Introduction to problem statement:-
The dorm and dining on campus for students has been a lot different than previous times. We have more diversity of cultures and religions, with this comes more diversification of food. Every university has multiple dorms, and students normally have a hard time finding the dorm that fits their needs. And the students currently in dorms face issues during their stay, and giving a rating and review would help upcoming students to be aware of the issues happening in a particular dorm. This rating will help universities to get up to the mark and fulfill students requirements.
 
#### Abstract:-
Creating a web-app where students can write reviews and rate the services of their university and all the affiliated universities can improvise using that feedback.

#### Approach:-
The web-app frontend will be made using ReactJS, HTML CSS and Bootstrap, with the backend technology being NodeJs for creating the RESTful API's. We will use the NOSQL database MONGODB for storage purposes.


#### Persona:-
##### Joseph:
Joseph is a freshmen looking for a dorm and he does not know which dorm to choose, he can go to the website to check the reviews and check which dorm suits best for him
##### Kyle:
Kyle is currently living in Joe West, and he realizes that Joe West restrooms are not maintained well, and there is no air conditioning in the dorm. He can leave a rating and review.

#### Idea-2:
#### ANONYMOUS STUDENT NETWORK

#### Problem Statement:
University Students do not have an existing forum where they can express their feelings, experience, and talk about their good and bad days by being anonymous. Having an anonymous student network where people can connect, share their tips and hacks, have fun, and share their thoughts. This would help the students understand their surroundings better.

#### Abstract:
People joining Universities have different mindsets, different goals, different majors, and a completely different lifestyle. There are thousands of students joining American Universities each year with a different set of expectations, and students can use this platform to express and discuss the opinions that matter to them. Being anonymous gives the students a space to be open about their thoughts. The application will give students a healthy platform for discussing their opinions.

#### Approach:
Frontend Technology: HTML, CSS, React.js
Backend Technology: Node.js, MongoDB
Docker will be utilized for containerization and AWS EC2 for application hosting.

#### Persona:
Tim Horton, a Math major student at SJSU, is having a hard time understanding the concepts introduced in Math 42 class. He wants to know how people are finding the class and wants to see if the seniors who took the class can give him some tips on how to approach the subject. He has imposters syndrome and does not want to go and ask his peers, because he thinks they might think he is not smart. He can go to our website and create a post asking for tips on how to do better in class. Both seniors and the current students in the class can help him.

No dataset Required
 

#### Idea-3:
#### MONEY TRANSFER APP

#### Introduction to the problem statement :
Making online money transactions has become inevitable these days and there is a lot of scope in the industry to develop a money transfer app which has a friendly user interface and smooth working experience for the users. The application which we develop would help people to send and receive money to one another easily and reliably.

#### Abstract:
Building a web application which helps users to transfer money with minimal effort.

#### Approach: 
Using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, ReactJS and Bootstrap we are going to build a money transfer web application which stores the  transactions made by the user in a MONGODB and display the current balance and transaction history for the users.

#### Persona:
A layman who is not well equipped with the knowledge of using money transfer apps might find it difficult to use the existing online money transfer apps. The application which we create will be helpful for him because it will hold a minimalistic view, so it will be easy to interact.

#### Dataset links: 
No dataset links are required for this project.

#### Idea 4:
#### TIMETABLE MANAGER

#### Introduction to problem statement :
A university student has to juggle a lot of things in a semester, from studying for multiple courses to working on their own other short term and long term goals, which is why there should be an effective system, to help students manage every goal in one place, by helping them manage their time effectively. The solution which we propose will help studentâ€™s time management problem, by allowing them to create a weekly schedule for coursework, quizzes, projects, and other peculiar agendas set for himself/herself. Students can also enter grades and track their class progress while also planning their next schedule without any conflicts with the current one.

#### Abstract:
Developing a web/mobile application where students can plan weekly study schedules for exams, study sessions, projects and other agendas. They can also enter grade data to keep track of the outcomes, and manage their academic goals wisely.

#### Approach:
Employing the MVC pattern, the frontend will be designed using React.js, HTML and CSS and will be connected to the backend system which will be developed using NodeJS and REST API which will be linked to MongoDB that will store the app data.

#### Persona:
End-users: Students who use the application to manage their academic schedule
Dataset Link: No dataset Required
